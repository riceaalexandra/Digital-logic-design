# Digital logic design
Welcome to my Digital logic design in Xilinx and ModelSim repository! <br>
This repository contains VHDL and schematic projects for various digital logic components such as adders, demultiplexers, counters, decoders, registers, memories and more. These projects are designed for digital logic design and implementation and can be used for educational or practical purposes.
